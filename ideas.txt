Topic ideas

Sports:  whenever someone breaks a record in the sporting world, our program would notice and notify us through a service like twitter or something. 

Music: whenever artists mention album releases, the program we would build would search the web and bring us relevant information as to when the album is released.

Politics: a live updater of campaign spending, seeing who has recently donated significant amounts of money

We narrowed it down to a music idea that aggregates reviews and filters them based on genre, artist, and review score. This information is all availible in different formats. The minimum we envision seeing being built is a script that people can use to ask and receive answers based on our filtering. The closest thing we see this being compared to is the website Metacritic.
